What is Knowledge Graph in NLP?
A knowledge graph is a way of storing data that resulted from an information extraction task. 
Many basic implementations of knowledge graphs make use of a concept we call triple, that is a set of three items(a subject, a predicate and an object) that we can use to store information about something.
In AI, knowledge graphs complement machine learning techniques to: reduce the need of large, labelled datasets; facilitate transfer learning and explainability; encode domain, task and application knowledge that would be costly to learn from data alone.
